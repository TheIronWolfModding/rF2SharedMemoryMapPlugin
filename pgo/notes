To collect/refresh PGO data:

1. Build Release_PGOGEN.  This would do two things:
	- Create instrumented rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin.dll
	- Overwrite pgo\rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin_saved.pgd with the new .pgd.  Do not check this one in yet, until step 7 is complete.
2. Place instrumented rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin.dll into game folder
3. Place pgort120.dll next to instrumented rFactor2.exe
5. Run the game
6. Copy rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin![N].pgc back to pgo folder
7. Build Realease_AVX2.  This will:
	- produce merged pgo\rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin.pgd
	- Overwrite pgo\rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin_saved.pgd with the new merged .pgd.
8. Check in the newly merged .pgd

Note: /USEPROFILE:AGGRESSIVE generates slightly bigger binary, I decided to keep it off because those functions most likely aren't even called by rF2.
