NOTES ON THIS VERSION
Unit tests added - build SMMP for debug and it will be lib which is used by the unit tests, build for Release and it's a DLL T_rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll which is copied to c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\rFactor 2\Bin64\Plugins
Use this entry in UserData\player\CustomPluginVariables.JSON:
  "T_rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll":{
    " Enabled":1,
    "DebugISIInternals":0,
    "DebugOutputLevel":5,
    "DedicatedServerMapGlobally":0,
    "EnableDirectMemoryAccess":1,
    "UnsubscribedBuffersMask":32
  },
"DebugISIInternals":1 crashes rF2 (the same crash in unit test if AccessPitMenu/WritePitMenuInternals is called TWICE because the fprintf pointer (I think that's what it is) is null the second time.

CheckHWControl did switch between the LCD modes and change the category but that stopped working when I commented out some DEBUG_MSGs.  Mystery!!

rF2SMMonitor edited to display rF2PitMenu but it never gets any information (because rF2PitMenu is not shared properly??)


# rFactor 2 Internals Shared Memory Map Plugin

This plugin mirrors exposed rFactor 2 internal state into shared memory buffers.  Essentially, this is direct memcpy of rFactor 2 internals.

Reading shared memory allows creating external tools running outside of rFactor 2 and written in languages other than C++ (C# sample is included).  It also allows keeping CPU time impact in rFactor 2 plugin threads to the minimum.

This plugin is carefully implemented with an intent of becoming a shared component for reading rF2 internals.  It can handle any number of clients without slowing down rF2 plugin thread.  A lot of work was done to ensure it is as efficient and reliable as possible.

#### This work is based on:
  * rF2 Internals Plugin sample #7 by ISI/S397 found at: https://www.studio-397.com/modding-resources/
#### Was inspired by:
  * rF1 Shared Memory Map Plugin by Dan Allongo found at: https://github.com/dallongo/rFactorSharedMemoryMap

## Download:
https://www.mediafire.com/file/hzlugtn3t7sc3gw/rf2_sm_tools_3.7.0.0.zip/file

## Features
Plugin offers optional weak synchronization by using version variables on each of the buffers.

Plugin is built using VS 2015 Community Edition, targeting VC12 (VS 2013) runtime, since rF2 comes with VC12 redist.

## Refresh Rates:
* Telemetry - 50FPS.
* Scoring - 5FPS.
* Rules - 3FPS.
* Multi Rules - on callback from a game, usually once a session and in between sessions.
* ForceFeedback - 400FPS.
* Graphics - 400FPS.
* Extended - 5FPS and on tracked callback by the game.

Note: Graphics buffer is unsbscribed by default.

## Unsubscribing from the buffer updatdes
It is possible to configure which buffers get updated and which don't.  This is done via `UnsubscribedBuffersMask` value in the `CustomPluginVariables.json` file.  To specify buffers to unsubscribe from, add desired flag values up.

`Telemetry = 1,
Scoring = 2,
Rules = 4,
MultiRules = 8,
ForceFeedback = 16,
Graphics = 32,
PitDisplay = 64`

So, to unsubscribe from `Multi Rules` and `Graphics` buffeers set `UnsubscribedBuffersMask` to 40 (8 + 32).

Note: unsubscribing from `Extended` buffer updates is not supported.

## Limitations/Assumptions:
* Negative mID is not supported.
* Distance between max(mID) and min(mID) in a session cannot exceed 512.
* Max mapped vehicles: 128.
* Plugin assumes that delta Elapsed Time in a telemetry update frame cannot exceed 2ms (which effectively limits telemetry refresh rate to 50FPS).

## Monitor
Plugin comes with rF2SMMonitor program that shows how to access exposed internals from C# program.  It is also useful for visualization of shared memory contents and general understanding of rFactor 2 internals.

## Memory Buffer Uses
  * Basic:   Most clients (HUDs, Dashes, visualizers) won't need synchronization, see `rF2SMMonitor.MainForm.MappedBuffer<>.GetMappedDataUnsynchronized` for sample implementation.
  * Advanced:  If you would like to make sure you're not 
  reading a torn (partially overwritten) frame, see `rF2SMMonitor.MainForm.MappedBuffer<>.GetMappedData` for sample implementation.

## Dedicated server use
If ran in dedicated server process, each shared memory buffer name has server PID appended.  If DedicatedServerMapGlobally preference is set to 1, plugin will attempt creating shared memory buffers in the Global section.  Note that "Create Global Objects" permission is needed on user account running dedicated server.

## Debugging
Set DebugOutputLevel in `UserData\<player>\CustomPluginVariables.json`
*  `Off = 0,`
*  `Errors = 1,`
*  `CriticalInfo = 2,      // Errors + Critical Info`
*  `DevInfo = 3,           // Errors + Critical Info + Dev Info`
*  `Warnings = 4,          // Errors + Critical Info + Dev Info + Warnings`
*  `Synchronization = 5,   // Errors + Critical Info + Dev Info + Warnings + Sync messages`
*  `Perf = 6,              // Errors + Critical Info + Dev Info + Warnings + Sync messages + Perf`
*  `Timing = 7,            // Errors + Critical Info + Dev Info + Warnings + Sync messages + Perf + Timing deltas`
*  `Verbose = 8            // All`


## Distribution and reuse
You are allowed to include this .dll with your distribution, as long as it is:
* Free
* Readme is included
* You had my permission via email

Please also be aware, that Crew Chief will always ship with the latest version of the .dll and will overwrite .dll to match its version.  I do not expect compatibility to break without game changing its model, aside from rF2Extended buffer, which contains stuff not directly exposed by the game.  Every time layout of memory changes, either of the first two digits in the Plugin version is incremented, which means clients might need an update.  Monitor app is kept in sync with plugin.

# Release history

**11/10/2019 - v3.7.1.0**

  Plugin:
  * Expose `UsubscribedBuffersMask` via `rF2Extended::mUnsubscribedBuffersMask`.  This can be used by clients to validate UBM, and might be made client writable in the future.

**11/08/2019 - v3.7.0.0**

Plugin:

* Expose rF2Graphics (GraphicsInfoV02) buffer via $rFactor2SMMP_Graphics$.  Note that it is not subsribed to by default.
* It is now possible to configure which buffers get updated and which don't.  This is done via `UnsubscribedBuffersMask` value in the `CustomPluginVariables.json` file.  To specify buffers to unsubscribe from, add desired flag values up.

`Telemetry = 1,
Scoring = 2,
Rules = 4,
MultiRules = 8,
ForceFeedback = 16,
Graphics = 32`

So, to unsubscribe from `Multi Rules` and `Graphics` buffers set `UnsubscribedBuffersMask` to 40 (8 + 32).
